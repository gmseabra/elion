VSDB uses the distribution of Dimorphite-DL created by
Jacob Durrant's lab, described 
[here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-019-0336-9), and 
available for download [here](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/dimorphite-dl/).

Some modifications were needded in the dimorphite_dl.py file,
and are indicated. The original file is also included here (dimorphite_dl.py_orig), as well as a diff file making the changes
explicit (dimorphite-dl.patch). 

Files that are ot needed for vsdb were removed.
